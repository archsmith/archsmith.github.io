			<h3>Cabinet</h3>
			<p>A casepiece cabinet designed with tropical character. This work is constructed of Peruvian Walnut (Brown) and Padauk (Red). Hand-cut joinery on the top surface exemplifies the stress on traditional woodworking methods stressed in class. Wood was selected for high contrast and visibility from far while detail in the shape of the surface is only noticable close-up.</p>

			<h3>Coral Gables Museum Mini Golf Hole</h3>
			<p>Our proposal sought to utilize an architectural element that would offer a dynamic playing experience and is unique to geographic locations. Roofs achieved this purpose and allowed us to incorporate local imagery seen in several ‘international villages’ such as Dutch South African, French, Spanish, and Chinese villages.</p>

			<h3>Field Sketches</h3>
			<p>The architect's sketchbook is often full of project notes and a flow of ideas. Sketches in the field are an excelent method of learning how existing projects are designed and constructed.</p>
